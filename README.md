# Gate Logic Adder
 -This project was done to explore how logic gates work and in doing so, make an adder using software to emulate hardware.
- After the code is run it is interacted with in the terminal.
- When the program prompts for a variable, numbers must be seperated by commas (1,0,1 = 101 or 0,0,1,0 = 0010)
- After variables are entered the program will return the sum by doing bit addition.
- Because it is bit addition, the prompts must be in 0's and 1's.
